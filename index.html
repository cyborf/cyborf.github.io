    <div id = "about">
        <p>I'm a Junior at Oberlin College, double-majoring in Computer Science and Politics, with a minor in Writing and Communication. 
            My research interests are: language models, language justice, and human-technology labour dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>I'm currently conducting HCI research at Professor Molly Feldman's Computation for Humans Lab, with a focus on generative models and their impact on student writing.
            Additionally, I am a Writing Associate at Oberlin's Writing Center, and Research Assistant to Professor Amanda Zadorian's Political Economy research project on Sovereign Wealth Funds.

        <p>In my free time, I like to hike, game, and/or do arts. I also LOVE cats!</p>

        <h2>"Comparing Human and Automated Approaches to Providing Writing Assistance"</h2>
        <p>Mentor: Professor Molly Q. Feldman, Professor Amanda Zadorian</p>
        <p>Writing assistance to college writing is a personalized and scaffolding process,
            that aims to provide students with the cognitive skills needed in the present assignments
            and future writing endeavour. As generative language models, like ChatGPT, become increasingly
            public-facing and accessible to new writers, we are interested in investigating how autogenerative, anthropomorphic
            writing assistance is received by students.
