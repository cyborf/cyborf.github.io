        <h1>> ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>I'm a Junior at Oberlin College, double-majoring in Computer Science and Politics, with a minor in Writing and Communication. 
            My research interests are: language models, language justice, and human-technology labour dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>I'm currently conducting HCI research at Professor Molly Feldman's Computation for Humans Lab, with a focus on generative models and their impact on student writing.
            Additionally, I am a Writing Associate at Oberlin's Writing Center, and Research Assistant to Professor Amanda Zadorian's Political Economy research project on Sovereign Wealth Funds.
            Check out my full <a href = "../cyborf.github.io/files/CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> here.
        </p>
        <p>In my free time, I like to hike, game, and/or do arts. I also LOVE cats!</p>

        <p><em>"Comparing Human and Automated Approaches to Providing Writing Assistance"</em></p>
        <p> Mentors: Professor Molly Q. Feldman, Professor Amanda Zadorian</p>
        <p> Writing assistance to college writing is a personalized and scaffolding process,
            which aims to provide students with the cognitive skills needed in present assignments
            and future writing endeavours. As generative language models, like ChatGPT, become increasingly
            public-facing and accessible to new writers, we are interested in investigating how autogenerative, anthropomorphic
            writing assistance is received by students.
