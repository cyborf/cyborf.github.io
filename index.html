    <div id = "about">
        <p>I'm a Junior at Oberlin College, double-majoring in Computer Science and Politics, with a minor in Writing and Communication. 
            My research interests are: language models, language justice, and human-technology labour dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>I'm currently conducting HCI research at Professor Molly Feldman's Computation for Humans Lab, with a focus on generative models and their impact on student writing.
            Additionally, I am a Writing Associate at Oberlin's Writing Center, and Research Assistant to Professor Amanda Zadorian's Political Economy research project on Sovereign Wealth Funds.

        <p>In my free time, I like to hike, game, and/or do arts. I also LOVE cats!</p>
